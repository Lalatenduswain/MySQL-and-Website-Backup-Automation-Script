## Script Structure

The script consists of various functions dedicated to each operation. Here are the key functions:

- **MySQL Operations**: `list_databases`, `list_database_sizes`, `create_database`, `delete_database`, `restore_database`, `restore_latest_backup`, `manage_users`
- **Backup Operations**:
  - **Database Backup**: `backup_menu`, `backup_database`, `schedule_backup`
